# Development of this bot is stopped due to lack of popularity

I'm not planning to come back to this project ever again, if so I will rewrite 50% of this code because It is junk. 

I'm leaving this to the public, if anyone wants to know how I did some of those commands, here is an open-source project. BTW. that bot was deleted I think in August 2020. 

You can contact me using discord:
My dev server: https://discord.gg/sWzvgZB
My discord profile (usually): uZer#9084

You can do whatever you can with this code, but please, don't copy, paste and publish as your project. I mean, I spent a chunk of time doing this stuff.
